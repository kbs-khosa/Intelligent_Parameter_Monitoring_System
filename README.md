# Intelligent_Parameter_Monitoring_System
# The model made use of ATmega32 which was interfaced with 3 sensors, soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor and photo detector.
# The sensors performed various tasks like monitoring the temperature, starting an alarm, keeping track of soil moisture to turn the water pump ON/OFF and also they helped in turning the farm lights ON in case of cloudy weather or during night time.
# The microcontroller was programmed befor connecting it to the circuit using softwares like CVAVR and DOCKLIGHT. The temperature sensor used here was LM35.
# Solar panels were also included in the model in case if extra power is needed at the farm.
# The project explained a model that can be used by farmers to increase the yield. Since the initial cost of the set up is very high so it was suggested that the set up can be installed by a group of farmers on a shared basis.
